# Configuration of where the data for monitoring should be copied to on the
# VISUALIZATION host. Note that this replaces everything up to your main user
# directory on the supercomputer to keep the experiment trees looking as
# similar as possible. In this example file this means that the monitoring
# files will be copied from:
#
# /work/ba0989/a270077/AWICM_PISM/LGM-CTRL_ICE6G_PISM_20km_atmosphere_only
#
# to
#
# /scratch/work/pgierz/AWICM_PISM/LGM-CTRL_ICE6G_PISM_20km_atmosphere_only
storagedir: /scratch/work/pgierz/

# Note that for general monitoring information; the little minus signs by the list
# of things you want is **mandatory**
general:
        - queue info
        - run efficiency
        - disk usage
        - simulation timeline
        - progress bar

# Note that the lack of minus signs is also **mandatory**
